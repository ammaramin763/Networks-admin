 I usually troubleshoot layer 1 and layer 2 in union because they are so closely paired. Examples of layer 2 – data link – are line protocol (such as Ethernet, ATM, 802.11, PPP, frame-relay, HDLC, or PPP).


To troubleshoot at these layers, the first thing I would do on your router is a show interface. Here is an example of a LAN Gigabit Ethernet circuit:

We can begin our troubleshooting by looking at the output of the ‘show ip ospf neighbor’ command.

Here Neighbor id is important since this shows the linked neighbor or Router id.
